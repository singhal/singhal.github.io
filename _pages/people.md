## Sonal Singhal
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sonal.jpg){: .align-right .width-third} I have been a professor at CSU Dominguez Hills since Fall 2017. I came to CSUDH via Ohio, with numerous stops for schooling and training along the way. My research uses genetics to reconstruct the evolutionary history of natural populations. Although I enjoy all aspects of research, my favorite part is data analysis. My teaching interests include genetics, ecology & evolution, and practical computing. Outside of school, you can find me cooking overly complicated meals, reading books, trying to do a pull-up, and spending time with my family & pups.

## Micah Castrillo
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cerille.jpeg){: .align-right .width-third} I am a current junior at CSUDH majoring in Environmental Science & Ecology. My general interests include conservation & ecological restoration, ichthyology, and phycology. If I’m not in the classroom, I love to be outdoors. You can typically find me scuba diving, snorkeling, hiking, and exploring new places in my free time.

## George Contreras

in microbiology. I plan to graduate in Spring 2022. The topics of biology that interest me include phylogenetics and taxonomy. I like these fields because they involve the exploration of different characteristics of a species to apply them to a specific category or ancestry. Outside of school, I like to sculpt, play piano, go on hikes, and [attempt to] cook new things.

I am a recent graduate from CSUDH with a degree in Biology - Ecology and Environmental Science with a minor in Anthropology. I was born in raised in Los Angeles, CA. I have various interests in the Biology field including genetics, behavioral interactions, and climate change in the environment. In my free time you can find me with book in my hand, catching up on a Netflix series, going on a nature walk, or improving my trombone playing.

## Itzel Ixta
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/itzel.png){: .align-right .width-third} I am currently a senior at CSUDH majoring in Cellular & Molecular Biology. I am mostly interested in genetics and evolution. I am the youngest of three children born and raised in Los Angeles. When I’m not in school or doing homework, you can find me spending time at home with my dog or drinking coffee at the beach.

## Chandra Jones
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/chandra.jpeg){: .align-right .width-third} I am a junior, and my major is Biology - Ecology and Environmental Science. I’ve always had an interest in the environment, including how it changes and what we can do to preserve the environment and the animals that live in it. In my free time I like taking care of my plants, going on nature walks, and spending time with my loved ones. I’ve recently enjoyed roller skating down at the beach with my partner.

## Susana Lopez-Ignacio
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/susana.png){: .align-right .width-third} I am third-year student majoring in Cell and Molecular Biology at CSU Dominguez Hills. A topic that interests me is genetics and its correlation to disorders.  In the future, I plan to get more involved with this topic and to dive into the field of neurology. When I have some free time, I like to go and try a new drink flavor at Boba Time or catch up on anime series or drama. I am also into fashion trends and do change my style quite often. In other words, I love shopping!

## Nicole Roberts
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nicole.png){: .align-right .width-third} Currently, I am a Masters student researching Ecological Niche Modelling in North American placental mammals. One joyous discovery I've made so far is how much I love statistics and programming. I plan to pursue conservation work using GIS and Remote Sensing and hope to better understand how climate change and human disturbances are affecting our world. Outside of graduate school, I am a trained opera singer (Lyric Soprano), short story writer, amateur LOTR enthusiast, and avid Instant Pot cooker. I love spending time with my family and two snakes, Noodle and Sausage.

## Alexis Widmann
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/alexis.jpg){: .align-right .width-third} I am currently a transfer junior at CSUDH from El Camino College. I’m working towards my B.S. in Molecular and Cellular Biology, where I intend to take that truly awesome degree all the way to graduate school where I will earn my M.S. in Genetic Counseling, my true passion. Outside of the lab and lecture you can still find me buried in biology textbooks and genetic pamphlets; some concerned family and friends worry I may have an obsession. Between you and me, I’ve only scratched the surface...
