## Sonal Singhal
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sonal.jpg){: .align-right .width-third} I have been a professor at CSU Dominguez Hills since Fall 2017. I came to CSUDH via Ohio, with numerous stops for schooling and training along the way. My research uses genetics to reconstruct the evolutionary history of natural populations. Although I enjoy all aspects of research, my favorite part is data analysis. My teaching interests include genetics, ecology & evolution, and practical computing. Outside of school, you can find me reading books, trying to do a pull-up, sewing quilts, and spending time with my family & pups.

I am a current senior at CSUDH, majoring in Ecology and Environmental Biology. I love learning about how organisms interact with their environment and the evolution of different species. Doing research has been a big part of my journey at Dominguez Hills. Outside of class I love taking care of fish, creating aquascapes, sketching dinosaurs, and going on bike rides with friends.

I am currently a sophomore at CSUDH working on my B.S. in Cellular and Molecular Biology. I am highly interested in Genetics and the effects that it has over the fitness of an organism and the evolution of the species. As a First Generation student, I always try to find mentors and learn from other’s experiences regarding academics and lifestyle balance so I can navigate new things on my own as well. Outside of school I usually try to play some tennis, go to the beach, watch some TV shows, and listen to a variety of music!

I’m a senior at CSUDH majoring in Ecology and Environmental Biology and minoring in Asian Pacific Studies. My rural upbringing helped me gain a deep appreciation for nature. I spent my life running around the forest catching bugs, lizards, and anything else I could get my hands on. My interests are in fisheries, water resources, sustainability, and environmental planning. I’ve seen habitat loss, wildlife population loss, and the negative effects of mankind on the environment firsthand, and would like to help find ways for us to coexist with nature. In my free time, I love to fish, aquascape, raise/breed freshwater marine organisms, and go camping.

I am a currently a graduate student here at CSUDH and happy to be a returning Toro. I graduated with my B.S. in Cellular and Molecular Biology from CSUDH, and I am now working towards getting my M.S. in Biology. As a DACA student, learning to navigate through the struggles of being an immigrant and a first generation college student was tough. I say this because, if you can relate, I want to tell you, "sí se puede". Outside of school you can find me spending time with my beautiful wife and puppy, lifting at my powerlifting gym, working at my newly started career, watching anime, or becoming an Elden Lord.

I am a Junior at CSU Dominguez Hills pursuing an Ecology and Environmental Biology major as a first-generation college student. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. Some of my biology field interests are ecology, botany, genetics and molecular biology. Outside of school I like to travel, visit new places and spend time outdoors which led to my interest in Biology.
