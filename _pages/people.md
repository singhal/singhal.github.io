## Sonal Singhal
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sonal.jpg){: .align-right .width-third} I have been a professor at CSU Dominguez Hills since Fall 2017. I came to CSUDH via Ohio, with numerous stops for schooling and training along the way. My research uses genetics to reconstruct the evolutionary history of natural populations. Although I enjoy all aspects of research, my favorite part is data analysis. My teaching interests include genetics, ecology & evolution, and practical computing. Outside of school, you can find me reading books, trying to do a pull-up, sewing quilts, and spending time with my family & pups.
