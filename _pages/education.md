## Outreach
In the past, our lab has been lucky to join these organizations:
- [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/)
- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/)
- [Code Nation](https://codenation.org/)
- [Prison University Program](https://prisonuniversityproject.org/) at San Quentin Prison
- [Breakthrough Collaborative](https://www.breakthroughcollaborative.org/)

In the future, we look forward to partnering with [CSI3](https://csi3.org/), CSU Dominguez Hills' ground-breaking center for science education and outreach.
